# Spreadsheet Analysis
## Data set details

### The origin of the data set 
I found the dataset "Student COVID Vaccinations (3-24-2022)" from NYC Open Data website, which is provided By New York City Department of Education. \[Link to dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Student-COVID-Vaccinations-3-24-2022-/q5xz-reje/data_preview)
\This dataset collects the number and percentage of New York City students who have taken the covid vaccine (w/ at least one dose & fully vaccinated). The original data file was in CSV.

### The first 20 rows of the the raw data

Describe the problems that were present in the data and the scrubbing tasks that were necessary to prepare your data set for import into a spreadsheet - include scrubbing done in Python, a text editor, or any other tool. Be specific with examples of the problems in the original data and the way in which those were solved. Feel free to show small snippets of relevant code - see the examples of code "syntax highlighting" in the Markdown guide linked above.

Links to your data files (the original raw data, the munged data, and the spreadsheet file including the formulas and charts). These can be links to files in your own repository or links to the files stored in a cloud storage service if your files are too large to be included in your own repository.
Analysis:

Describe each of the aggregate statistic you have calculated - include a description of each and describe any insights the statistic shows that may not be obvious to someone just viewing the raw data.

If using a pivot table for analysis, include a Markdown table showing a sample of the results of the pivot table (no more than 20 rows, please), along with a short description of what the results show and any insights they offer.

If using a chart for visualization, include the chart image in the report, with a short description of what the image shows and any insights it offers. See the Markdown guide linked above for details of showing an image.
