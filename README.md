# Spreadsheet Analysis
Data set details:

The origin of your data set - what is it and where does it come from. Include a link to the URL of the source.
What format the original data file was in (CSV, JSON, or other).

Display some of the raw data from the original data file (the first 20 rows is enough). Use Markdown's ability to display tables - see the examples in the Markdown guide linked above.

Describe the problems that were present in the data and the scrubbing tasks that were necessary to prepare your data set for import into a spreadsheet - include scrubbing done in Python, a text editor, or any other tool. Be specific with examples of the problems in the original data and the way in which those were solved. Feel free to show small snippets of relevant code - see the examples of code "syntax highlighting" in the Markdown guide linked above.

Links to your data files (the original raw data, the munged data, and the spreadsheet file including the formulas and charts). These can be links to files in your own repository or links to the files stored in a cloud storage service if your files are too large to be included in your own repository.
Analysis:

Describe each of the aggregate statistic you have calculated - include a description of each and describe any insights the statistic shows that may not be obvious to someone just viewing the raw data.

If using a pivot table for analysis, include a Markdown table showing a sample of the results of the pivot table (no more than 20 rows, please), along with a short description of what the results show and any insights they offer.

If using a chart for visualization, include the chart image in the report, with a short description of what the image shows and any insights it offers. See the Markdown guide linked above for details of showing an image.
